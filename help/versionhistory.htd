          phones.

      <li><p><b>LG VX6100</b> Underscore character "_" now supported in

      ringer and wallpaper file names.  Number of ringers allowed

      increased from 30 to 60.  Number of wallpaper allowed increased

      from 30 to 60.  Number of camera images allowed increased from

      20 to 60.

    <h2><a name="0.7.24">Changes in 0.7.24</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>Bitmap (BMP) images with less than 236 colours are saved in

      the smaller 8 bit format (ie using a palette).



      <li><p>The wallpaper and ringtone displays have been replaced with

      an improved user interface in both functionality and appearance.

      The wallpaper display now works out image information directly

      from the file (eg you could rename a jpeg to .png and it will

      see work out that it is jpeg).  You can also organize in various

      ways (try the right click menu).  The ringtone display also uses

      the new interface but doesn't have the file type recognition or

      organizing implemented yet.



      <li><p>The matching of imported/incoming phonebook entries against

      what you already have has been sped up.  (A C implementation of

      the Jaro Winkler algorithm is used.)  There is also a progress

      dialog with estimated remaining time displayed if there is a lot

      of matching to do (multiply the number of incoming items with

      the number of existing items to get an idea of how much work is

      done).



      <li><p>The phonebook and calendar data is now stored in a

      transactional database (we use SQLite behind the scenes) which

      allows for implementing undo, archiving of old entries,

      concurrent instances of BitPim, storing old data so we can

      calculate changes for doing syncing and various other goodness.

      The other types of data (eg wallpaper and ringtones) will also

      be changing to use this database.



      <li><p>There is now an improved user interface for adding and

      editing calendar events.  Most of the phone modules do not (yet)

      support the extra fields available, but will do so over the next

      few releases.



      <li><p><b>SCH-A670</b> Phonebook contacts now fully support wallpaper

      and ringtone assignments.  Uploaded wallpapers are automatically

      converted to 128x96 24-bit BMP format and can be used for

      phonebook wallpaper assignments.  Better transition in and out of

      File System mode.  Calendar repeat events are now supported.



      <li><p><b>SCH-A650</b> Wallpaper images with 256 colors or fewer are

      converted to 8-bit PNG format.  Others are converted to 24-bit PNG

      format.  Better transition in and out of File System mode.  Calendar

      repeat events are now supported.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo MM-7400</b> Disable reading of ringer/wallpaper

      assignments (which are really not handled properly for Sanyo phones

      anyway) so that phonebook read will work.  Disabled calendar options

      as they seem not to work.

 

    </ul>

      <li><p>You can now import phonebook contact information from eGroupware



      <li><p><b>Windows</b> The Microsoft CHM (Compressed HTML) format

      help file is now used from within BitPim, and so you will get

      the standard Microsoft Help viewer instead of the wxWidgets one.

      As a bonus the Microsoft Viewer understands stylesheets so you

      will see the help text in all its green glory!

      <li><p>Various minor tweaks and cleanups.



      <li><p>Sometimes Outlook comma separates the Categories field

      instead of semi-colon like normal.  BitPim now deals with this

      in the import.



      <li><p>Fixed omitted field that was caused by importing vcards with

      a "uid" field.



      <li><p><b>LG VX7000</b> Support for this phone has now been added

      thanks to a phone loan by <a

      href="misc-rpiwireless.htm">RPI Wireless</a>.  LG took the

      opportunity to make the firmware functionality and quality worse

      than their previous phones.  There may still be some problems

      where the code assumes the phone won't be as stupid as it

      actually is.



        <ul>



          <li><p>The phonebook reading and writing works, although there

          may be some minor issues with the writing due to the new

          restricted fields available.  It also looks like the speed

          dials might not be written exactly right due to the phone

          re-arranging some phone numbers some of the time.



          <li><p>LG halved the number of phone number types available.

          Phone number types that the phone doesn't have (eg Pager)

          are ignored.



          <li><p>The phone is very reluctant to reveal how many phonebook

          entries are present.  BitPim works around this, but the

          workaround will fail if you have no entries at all.

          Consequently do not ask BitPim to read the phonebook if it

          is empty.



          <li><p>Calendar reading/writing doesn't work.  (They tweaked

          some of the fields since prior phone models).



          <li><p>Wallpaper and ringtone reading and writing work.  The

          BitPim code currently limits you to 50 of each.  If anyone

          knows what the real limit is, or why the phone goes to the

          trouble of storing the total amount of space used by the

          ringtones and wallpapers then please post on bitpim-devel.



        </ul>

    <h2><a name="0.7.18">Changes in 0.7.18</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>You can now filter by categories in the import dialogs.



      <li><p>Your previous settings for the filters (eg requiring a name,

      number, email address etc) as well as the categories are

      remembered.



      <li><p>vCard import now understands charsets instead of always

      using ISO 8859-1.  It also correctly deals with vCards already

      in a Unicode file as Apple Addressbook likes to do.



      <li><p>All the standard character set converters are now included

      with the binary distribution of BitPim instead of just two or

      three.  This allows almost any charset to be used in vcards.



      <li><p>An issue with transparency and black backgrounds on 16 bit

      colour displays on Windows was fixed (thanks to Kevin Swan for

      providing the test files and screenshots).



      <li><p>We decided to stay with wxPython 2.5.  Currently the Mac

      version is not Unicode, but the other platforms are.  That will

      be addressed in the future.



      <li><p>Many minor tweaks and fixes for GUI issues reported on the

      mailing lists.  Thanks to all those who took the time to give

      accurate reproducible reports.



      <li><p>Fixed a filesystem protocol issue where the LG VX7000 was

      behaving differently than all the other phones.  This will fix

      some Motorola V710 issues as well.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b>

      	<ul>

	<li><p>For some Sanyo phones, the default (first)

        phone number for each name will be preserved for reads and writes.

	<li><p>Deleting call alarms read from phone won't cause exception.

	(Pre 0.7.18 calendar data must be overwritten by reading from phone.)

	</ul>



      <li><p><b>Samsung A620</b> Added support for downloading camera

      pictures.  No support yet for phonebook, calendar, wallpapers

      etc.



    </ul>







    <h2><a name="0.7.17">Changes in 0.7.17</a></h2>



    <ul>

      

      <li><p>The only change in this version is that BitPim now uses

      wxPython 2.5.  wxPython is the library BitPim uses for the user

      interface (GUI).  This is a significant stability and

      compatibility upgrade against the previous version of wxPython.

      Mac users in particular should notice a big difference.  For

      Linux users, the underlying library is changed from GTK1 to GTK2

      which is nicer as well.  <b>Note</b> We have not made any bug

      fixes or any other behavioral changes.  This is so that we can

      distinguish issues being with the upgrade to wxPython 2.5 vs

      generic in BitPim.



      <li><p>With the upgrade to wxPython 2.5, BitPim now also uses

      unicode for the user interface.  We have not yet tested how the

      phones will deal with this.  They likely won't like it.  We will

      be fixing this is future BitPim releases.  You are advised not

      to try non-ascii characters until we fixed the various phone

      modules to cope with it correctly.

      

    </ul>





    <h2><a name="0.7.16">Changes in 0.7.16</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>The correct entries are used when you use "selected entries"

      for phonebook printing or vCard export.



      <li><p>You can now select all with Ctrl-A, delete with the Del key

      and add new with Ctrl-N in most panes.



      <li><p>Speed dials are now shown in [square brackets] in the

      various phonebook views.



      <li><p>The dialog that helps show how newly read phonebook data is

      merged with existing data is back with completely new user

      interface.  Please click the Help button to understand what it

      is showing and how to change things.



      <li><p>US phonenumbers are now normalised and formatted in a

      standard way.  Other phone numbers are left alone.



      <li><p>Improved vcard output.  Unfortunately several programs

      refuse to import them despite following the standard to the

      letter.  Any assistance in figuring out how the other programs

      are broken would be appreciated.



      <li><p>Some changes to the underlying code for escaping and

      unescaping characters in the protocols.  This was needed because

      the Samsung SCH-A650 was unnecessarily escaping data which the

      code didn't account for.  Thanks to Stu Grossman for discovering

      this.



      <li><p>When you double click on a field in the phonebook, the

      editor starts up with focus on that field.



      <li><p>More columns are available in the phonebook view.  They are

      of interest if you have entries with lots of data (eg more than

      5 phone numbers).  Note that BitPim has always stored all data,

      it just didn't have columns pre-defined for all of it.



      <li><p>You <b>must</b> use a device driver instead of direct USB

      access to phones modem interfaces or USB to serial devices.

      Although the help makes this somewhat clear, many users

      try anyway.  BitPim will now mark those interfaces as unavailable.



      <li><p><b>Windows</b> Some of the packages BitPim uses started

      leaving off version numbers on their DLLs.  This caused the

      installer to not replace the older files with the new ones.  The

      installer has now been told to always replace files in the

      BitPim program files directory.  That will ensure upgrades and

      downgrades always work as expected (as of 0.7.16 anyway).

      Thanks to Allen Day for finding the underlying cause.



     <li><p><b>Sanyo phones</b> Fixed reading of calendar which was broken in

	0.7.15.



     <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-4920</b> Really actually fix the  ordering of

	phone number types.



    </ul>





    <h2><a name="0.7.15">Changes in 0.7.15</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>You can now export the phonebook in vCard format.  Note that

      this code is still a work in progress and is still being worked

      on.  (The vCard standard is hairy and no other program

      implements vCards 100% to the letter, so the export code is

      trying to deal with that).



        <p>Also note that there is a bug that means the wrong entries

          are output when you ask to export just the selected ones.

          This will be fixed in the next release.  (The same bug

          affects printing and no one had spotted it!)



      <li><p>You can now import Evolution contacts that are not 

	stored in db files.  BitPim runs

	<code>evolution-addressbook-exporter</code> behind the scenes. 

	Note that you must be running Evolution 1.4 for this to

	work.  [Code from Peter Pletcher]



     <li><p><b>Sanyo phones</b> Fixed crash on upload of some calendar entries.

        Events written to phone will show proper alarm interval on phone.

        Media write code will only try to write wallpaper and ringers that

        are not already on phone.  Media code will not try to write camera

        pictures.  BitPim will still often encounter errors from the phone

        (Usually "Sanyo Error code 109") because of Sanyo file size

        limitations.  See the note on

        <a href="phones-sanyo-notes.htm#mediaerrors">Sanyo Error Codes</a> for

        more information.



     <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-4920</b> Actually fix the  ordering of phone number

	types so that they agree on the phone and in BitPim.  (0.7.13 fix

	didn't work)



      <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-8100 (Bell Mobility-Canada)</b> Fixed reading and

	writing of the phonebook.





    </ul>



    <h2><a name="0.7.14">Changes in 0.7.14</a></h2>



    <ul>

      

      <li><p>There is no longer any console output on Linux or Mac,

	and there shouldn't be the I/O errors on Windows which

	were indirectly caused by console output issues when

	a console isn't present.



      <li><p>vCard reading sped up considerably



      <li><p>If the files supplied for CSV or vCard import are in Unicode

      (eg UTF 16) then they will be read correctly



      <li><p>You can now import contacts from Qtopia Desktop (eg as used

      with the Sharp Zaurus)



      <li><p>The dialog used to confirm a phonebook being read in/imported

	is now not shown.  It was coming up blank for many Mac users

	and was somewhat user unfriendly anyway.  Any UI designers out

	there want to help work on a replacement?



      <li><p><b>LG VX4500</b> Speed dials now read/written correctly



      <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b> Reduce WALLPAPER_HEIGHT for several

             phones so that wallpaper uploads won't fail



      <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-8100 (Bell Canada)</b> Initial support for the Bell

        (Canada) version of the SCP-8100.  The firmware in this phone

	is somewhat different from Sprint 8100.  This release can read the

        phonebook, wallpaper and ringers from the phone.  However, writing

	to the phonebook and reading/writing the calendar will crash BitPim.



    </ul>



    <h2><a name="0.7.13">Changes in 0.7.13</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>You can now import contacts from Outlook.  The importing

      should work well.



      <li><p>You can import contacts from Evolution.  You may experience

      some issues.  Please include an exported vcard of any problem

      records if you make any bug reports.  The Evolution importer

      uses the vCard importer behind the scenes so please read the

      notes below.



      <li><p>You can import contacts from vCards.  You may experience

      some issues.  Please include the vcard if you make any bug reports.



	<blockquote><b>Note</b> The vCard import code is very slow

	  and the vCard "standard" is a great big hairy mess that 

	  no program implements correctly.  BitPim does its best

	  (part of the reason the code is slow).  There will be

	  speed ups in future releases.

	</blockquote>



      <li><p>BitPim no longer makes any attempt to convert

	ringtones you add to be in a valid format.  That

	functionality will be added in the next major release.



      <li><p>Considerably sped up the display of images in the 

	right hand pane for wallpaper view



     <li><p><b>LG Phones</b> If the phonebook has multiple entries with the

	same serial number (which is a serious problem) then BitPim detects

	this and raises an alert.



     <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b> Added ability to write wallpaper and ringers for

        all Sanyo phones.

      <li><p>Various minor tweaks and bug fixes for issues commonly

	occurring in the mailing lists



      <li><p>Tweaked where the settings that remembered window sizes

      and positions is stored to make the config file/registry a

      little cleaner.  The first time you run this version it

      will use the default sizes/positions, and remember them 

      from that point on.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo phones</b> Transfer of ringtones from phone fixed.

	(For those phones that support media downloads, namely everything

	except 4900 and 5300.)  Sanyo PM-8200 is still read-only.



    </ul>



    <h2><a name="0.7-test10">Changes in 0.7 - test 10</a></h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>The routines to switch into Brew mode and LG phonebook mode

      have been tweaked and should be more reliable.



      <li><p><b>Mac</b> The preferences and About dialog are now in the

      normal place for Mac applications.



      <li><p><b>Audiovox CDM8900</b> This phone is no longer supported by

      BitPim.  Do not use this phone with BitPim.  Do not ask for

      support.  The internal software in this phone is very fragile,

      and the phone can be rendered completely inoperable through trivial

      operations.



      <li><p><b>LG TM520/VX10</b> The code has been re-instated for this

      phone.  The other LG items in this change log do not apply to

      this phone which uses different code.



      <li><p><b>LG VX4600</b> Reading/writing wallpapers and ringtones

      for this phone added.  Status of phonebook and calendar is not

      known.



      <li><p><b>LG phones</b> BitPim previously required that entries

      have at least one phone number to write them to the phone.  This

      has now been relaxed to fit the phone's requirement that there

      is at least one phone number or at least one email address.  (ie

      previously BitPim wouldn't write an entry with only an email

      address and no phone numbers.  Now it will).



      <li><p><b>LG phones</b> LG phones now use slightly different code

      for determining the number of phonebook entries.  It now also

      works correctly with phones that can have more than 255

      phonebook entries and you actually have more than that number of

      entries.



      <li><p><b>LG phones</b> Speed dials are now read and written.

	

      <li><p><b>LG phones</b> If the speed dials or group information

      change (ie different than what is already stored on the phone),

      then the phone has to be rebooted for the change to take effect.

      BitPim does this automatically.



      <li><p><b>LG phones</b> You no longer get an exception if the

      description for a calendar entry is too long.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo phones</b> Phonebook on phone no longer messed up

      if duplicate names are written to phone.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-5400 and SCP-7300</b> Broken in test9, now

      fixed.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo SCP-5400, SCP-5500, SCP-7300, SCP-8100</b> Improved

      media reading from these phones.  Images and ringtones from the

      camera, Vision download, and cable upload areas can now be read

      from the phone.  Filenames for camera images have "$camera_"

      prepended so they are not overwritten by wallpapers made from

      pictures.  Mp4 videos on SCP-5500 won't crash BitPim.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo PM-8200</b> Untested, read-only support added.

      Reading of the phonebook will probably work.  Reading the

      calendar, camera images, wallpaper and ringers may work.

    <li><p>BitFling is finally available



    <li><p>Started wallpaper download support for Sanyo SCP-8100 and

      SCP-5500.  Only camera pictures on the phone will be

      downloaded.  Wallpaper on the phone that was uploaded with Vision or by

      cable is not yet transferred.  Videos (on the SCP-5500) will be

      <li><p>Any combinations of carriage returns and newlines can be used 

	to terminate the end of line for importing CSV files.



      <li><p>The ringers pane now uses the same layout and underlying code

	as the wallpaper pane.  This makes it usable under Mac and

	Linux.  Double clicking items has no effect any more though as

	that code is incomplete.

      

      <li><p><b>LG VX6000</b> BitPim converts images to BMP.  It was

    <ul>

      

      <li><p>Added 'Other CDMA Phone' type that you can select if your phone uses

	the Brew filesystem protocol, but the other features are not supported

	in BitPim.



      <li><p>Started Audiovox CDM 8900 support



      <li><p>BitPim has changed to the GNU GPL license (details in the LICENSE file

    <h2>Changes in 0.7 - test 4</h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>You can now print from the phonebook.



      <li><p>The wallpaper tab is now based on a new 'media' displayer

      which will also be used for ringtones, voice memos etc.  This 3

      pane layout lets you see thumbnails, and detailed information at

      the same time.  There is also a preview area on the right where

      many actions will be available (eg format conversions, mass

      resizing).  Please report any problems you see in the interface.

	  <li><p>Rename

	  <li><p>Preview area

	  <li><p>Double clicking/Open launching an external program

	</ul>



      <li><p>Wallpapers: The format to convert added images to, the maximum name

      length and filename characters (as well as case) now come from

      each phone's profile rather than being hardcoded to BMP, 19

      characters and lower case alphanumerics.  VX6000 users will now

      appreciate the default format for them being JPEG.



      <li><p><b>Windows</b> Now using py2exe 0.5 and InnoSetup 4.1.5.

      The new LZMA (aka 7zip) compression in the latter results in a

      700kb smaller setup file.



      <li><p><b>LG VX4500</b> This phone has been added but testing of

      writing the phonebook is not complete.  Additionally some values

      may still be wrong for builtin wallpaper names, sizes and

      formats etc.  If you have some developer ability (eg you can

      convert between decimal and hexadecimal) then please join

      bitpim-devel mailing list and help complete support for this

      phone.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b> Fix calendar saving which was broken in test 3.



    </ul>



    <h2>Changes in 0.7 - test 3</h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>If a read or write of a file in the filesystem takes more than 3

	seconds, the log will now tell you how many bytes per second the

	transfer worked out at.

	

      <li><p>Several data integrity measures in the Brew protocol code.  This

	includes throwing exceptions if file sizes don't match expectations,

	verifying protocol checksums, logging junk data in packets etc

	

      <li><p>You can now put phones into offline mode as well as reboot them.

	To do so, right click on a directory in the filesystem view

	and choose the relevant option.  Offline mode may help overwriting

	some files.  Note that once in offline mode your phone will

	not do any calls and will probably display a fairly scary message

	on the display.  The only way to get out of offline mode is to

	reboot the phone, either through the menu or manually.

	

	<p>It has also been my experience that the LG phones do not 

	  correctly setup their USB if you reboot them while attached

	  to the computer.  Unplugging the cable and putting it back

	  in fixes that.



      <li><p>USB debugging (of libusb) has been turned off.  It seemed to be

	causing some problems on Mac, and wasn't being particularly useful

	anyway.

	  

      <li><p><b>LG VX4400/6000</b> Added data integrity measures to LG

	sync protocol (the code is very similar to the Brew protocol

	code and the measures are the same as described above).

	

      <li><p><b>LG VX4400/6000</b> Zero length calendar files are now dealt with

	correctly.  This would typically happen if you had never used your

	calendar.

	

      <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b> The Date/Time for calendar entries is now

	correct for all time zones, not just EST.



      <li><p><b>Sanyo Phones</b> Now silently truncates long phone numbers

	instead of failing.  Also get first phone number type when bitpim

	data not sorted.



    </ul>

    <ul>



      <li><p>You can now clear the contents of the log panes from the

	view menu



      <li><p>Fixed several nasty issues that would affect first time

	users with poor interaction between config dialogs, splash

	screens and the help tour appearing.

      

      <li><p>The get and send dialogs now adjust to what features are

	supported between BitPim and your phone.  For example it

	won't allow you to select wallpapers on Sanyo phones since

	we don't have that code (yet).



      <li><p>Several updates to the CSV import, including implementing

      the "Private" and "Category" fields, adding a "Categories"

      field, adding a toggle so you can say whether the first row is

      headers or not (the DSV library guesses weren't too reliable),

      none of the filters are ticked by default.



      <li><p>You can now sort by any column in the phonebook



      <li><p>There are now first, middle and last name columns available in 

	the phonebook



      <li><p>Implemented missing code that will derive a full name from its

	pieces (and vice versa).  This is relevant where an entry was

	imported as pieces (f,m,l) but phones write out only a full

	name (or vice versa).



      <li><p>You can double click in the phonebook entry preview (on the

	right) to edit the entry.



      <li><p>When using libusb, we have a builtin database of vendor, product and

	interface information as well USB protocols.  This is used to give

	more detail in the port browser.



      <li><p>Modems are now also listed along with serial ports (and workalikes)

	in the com port browser.  This means that auto-detection of Sanyo

	phones should work.



      <li><p>Devices that are likely to be the selected phone are now marked with

	an asterisk in the com port browser



      <li><p>The com port browser and auto detect code are now passed the phone

	module and only pay attention to devices that are that phone (before 

	they would notice any phone supported by BitPim)



      <li><p><b>Windows</b> Generate a dotted quad style version id for bitpim.exe

	otherwise upgrades can leave old versions of the executable in place

	when upgrading.



      <li><p><b>LG VX4400</b> BitPim now works correctly if your phonebook is

	completely empty.



      <li><p><b>LG VX4400/VX6000</b> BitPim now copes if the calendar exceptions

	file is not present.



      <li><p><b>LG TM520/VX10</b> These phones are no longer being maintained

	and cannot be selected.  If you would like to maintain them, please

	follow the instructions on the BitPim developer page.



    </ul>





    <h2>Changes in 0.7 - test 1</h2>



	<ul>



        <li><p>You can save the contents of the com port browser as HTML

        so other people can see what you see.



	<li><p>Protocol descriptions are now used throughout making

	maintenance and coding a lot easier.



	<li><p>Exceptions have their details copied to the Log window



	<li><p>Exceptions now include local variables from the last 6 frames

	making it easier to diagnose what happened



	<li><p>If a protocol decoding exception occurs, then buffer

	details are dumped to the ordinary log



	<li><p>Introduced a 0.3 second delay after grabbing each file

	when making a backup.  If this isn't done the phone eventually

	gets overwhelmed and returns truncated buffers amongst other

	things



	<li><p>Support for Sanyo 4900/8100 added



	<li><p>Support for LG VX6000 added.  Thanks to URL(misc-rpiwireless.htm,www.rpiwireless.com) for

	the loan of a phone and cable.



	<li><p>There is incomplete support for the LG TM520 and VX10.

	Developers are welcome to contribute the remainder of the

	support.



        <li><p>Totally revamped phonebook pane



	<li><p>Phonebook entry editor that allows ordering and editing

	 of all fields



	<li><p>Groups can be edited in the phonebook entry editor



	<li><p>Phonebook entries can be imported from CSV with predefined

	profiles for Palm Desktop, Mozilla and Outlook Express



	<li><p>Import dialog with intelligent matching against

	existing entries (in a similar manner to how you do reconciliation

	with banking programs).



	<li><p>The wallpaper view resizes all images when viewing (note the

        files on disk are <b>not</b> modified.  This means that you

	will see complete camera images rather than just the top left

	corner.



	<li><p>BitPim can now access appropriate devices via direct USB

	even if a driver is not installed.  This allows using straight

	USB cables on all platforms.  Note however that the VX4400 has

	a timeout issue in its USB implementation that also affects

	direct USB access.  The VX6000 and other phones do not have

	this problem.



	<li><p><b>Windows</b> Fixed a bug in comscan that could result in

	not completely enumerating registry keys.  This would result

	in some COM ports not being found that were perfectly valid.



        <li><p><b>Windows</b> Updated to InnoSetup 4



	<li><p><b>LG VX4400/VX6000</b> When writing out wallpaper/ringtones,

	files to be written are only actually written if they are

	a different length than the one on the phone.  This makes it

	considerably quicker to update wallpapers and ringtones.



	<li><p><b>LG VX4400/VX6000</b> The groups file on the phone is

	now updated based on the categories you use in your entries.

	Please see the phone specific notes in the online help for

	important information about this.  Support requests where the

	notes have obviously not been read will be ignored.



	<li><p><b>LG VX4400/VX6000</b> The algorithm for ordering and

	values of the indices for wallpapers and ringtones was changed.

	If you read in everything, you can delete the index files from

        the filesystem view and write out your phonebook, calendar,

	wallpaper and ringtones.  The new indices will start from zero

	and all phonebook entries etc will be updated.  It appears that

	the VX4400 is less stupid with the new number allocation scheme.



	<li><p><b>LG VX4400/VX6000</b> Wallpaper and ringtone index files

	will be created if they don't exist already.



	<li><p><b>Developer</b> A protocol analyser is available.  Press

	Ctrl-Alt-P in a Log pane to see it.  You can also run the

	standalone version.



	<li><p><b>Developer</b> Protocol examples are in the examples

	directory in CVS



      <li><p><b>Developer</b> There is code to interface with the

	Windows Address Book using COM/MAPI in <code>native/wab</code>



	</ul>



	<h2>Changes in 0.62</h2>



 	<ul>

	<li><p>Scrolling in the log windows now always leaves text visible

	<li><p>Absurd dates on files in filesystem view no longer cause an exception

	<li><p>Work around the LGE buggy driver which has difficulty with the concept

            of timeouts

        <li><p>Updated to pySerial 2, wxPython 2.4.2.4 on all platforms and

            Python 2.3.2 on Windows

	</ul>

    



	<h2>Changes in 0.61</h2>



	<ul>

	<li><p>Com port detection works correctly on Windows 2000

	<li><p>Device drivers with incorrectly formatted dates are handled without generating an error

	</ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.6 - test 5</h2>



	<ul>



	<li><p>Fixed reading file contents to be more stringent.  This corrected

	an issue seen with the LG VX6000 that returned extra nonsense on the

	end of read file requests.



	<li><p>Added *, #, P and T as the list of allowed characters in phone numbers

	for the VX4400



	<li><p>You can now paste from the clipboard into wallpaper tab.  (Not too useful

	since you will probably want to crop the images yourself, as well as give them

	a sensible name.)



	<li><p>Hid the File Print/Print Preview menu items since they don't do anything

	either



	<li><p>John Franklin figured out the ?internal field for calendar entries



	</ul>









      <h2>Changes in 0.6 - test 4</h2>



	<ul>



	<li><p>BCI (Brew Compressed Images) are now supported.  They will be displayed

	in the wallpaper view, and correctly uploaded to the phone etc.



	<li><p>Filesystem view now shows file sizes and last modified dates



	<li><p>You can backup and restore directories/trees from the filesystem view



	<li><p>All issues in open SourceForge bug reports fixed



	<li><p>Updated to newest pySerial



	</ul>





      <h2>Changes in 0.6 - test 3</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>Removed the 'Version Information' setting from get phone

      data, as it isn't possible with the straight USB cable, and

      requires the phone to be in RS232 mode with the USB to serial

      cable.  You can easily get this information from the phone

      itself.



	<li><p>Removed the File Save/New/Open menus as they did nothing,

	and some users may have been lead to believe they did



	<li><p>Splash screen



	<li><p>Online help is hooked in



	<li><p>Include a manifest file so that Windows XP users will

	see all the widgets in their hideous XP style glory



	<li><p>Removed the separate version history html file since it

	is now part of the online help



	<li><p>Updated to Python 2.3 on Windows



	<li><p>Tour is now shown on startup if it is the first time you

	have run BitPim



	 <li><p>Auto comm port detection and recovery on comms errors.



	<li><p>Config dialog no longer pops up on first use as sensible

	decisions are made.  You can now browse the com ports in the

	config dialog



	<li><p>Filesystem view being on/off now remembered

	

	<li><p>The notebook page/pane you were last viewing is remembered and set

	on startup



	<li><p>The files stored on disk are now versioned so if the format

	changes on an upgrade, old ones can be dealt with appropriately



	<li><p>Huge numbers of minor usability and functionality fixes



	</ul>





      <h2>Changes in 0.6 - test 2</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>Now make two attempts to open commport with a delay as it sometimes fails on first

	open

      <li><p>Added a half second delay when switching baud rates as the phone may not be able

	to switch as quickly as the host

	</ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.6 - test 1</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><p>Can now read and write files bigger than 64kb

      <li><p>Calendar is now shown

      <li><p>Worked around Python bug that joins("f:\\", "subdir") giving "f:\\\\subdir"

	which is not a valid pathname.  This should only have affected users who

	told BitPim to use the root directory of a drive, or who mapped their

	My Documents folder to the root directory of a drive.

    </ul>



   <h2>Changes in 0.53</h2>





    <ul>

      <li><p>Also ignore ZbThumbnail.info in the BitPim wallpaper directory (some camera software

	litters the directory with it)

	</ul>







     <h2>Changes in 0.52</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>The ringtone tab was also refreshed if you selected to only get wallpaper

      <li><p>Reading images/ringtones from the phone ONLY uses the index now.  The

	brew/shared directory could also contain other stuff such as scores from

	games that BitPim should have been ignoring.

      <li><p>You can now do merging as well as overwriting when sending wallpapers

	and ringtones to the phone.

      <li><p>Increased precision of calculation for scaling since it was sometimes

	out by one pixel

      <li><p>Added refresh to the context menu of directories in filesystem view.

	You can refresh anyway by closing and opening the directory, but this

	wouldn't work with empty directories.

    </ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.51</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>Index generation for ringtones and wallpapers corrected

	</ul>





      <h2>Changes in 0.5</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>If you change the comm port while BitPim is running, it will

	actually pick up the change (in earlier versions you had to exit

	and restart due to a bug).

	<li><p>If mode transition fails, you now get a helpful dialog explaining

	possible steps to resolve.

	<li><p>Files in the root directory in filesystem view are now listed

	<li><p>Files are displayed in the wallpaper and ringtone view in alphabetical order

	<li><p>The wallpaper and ringtone index files are somewhat cleaner, although the

	phone still misbehaves is you delete an entry on the phone (this is a bug

	in the phone and happens no matter what tool you use)

	<li><p>No more than 30 index entries are added for the wallpaper and ringtone indexes (the limit of the phone)

	<li><p>Added a guid in the installer setup so that previous versions are uninstalled

	correctly.  It is recommended that you uninstall versions before 0.5 before

	installing 0.5 to keep your add/remove programs entries clean.

	<li><p>Wallpapers and ringtones are written out in alphabetical order

	<li><p>BitPim now has an icon

	<li><p>We now send a generic initialization command.  This allows the filesystem

	view to work on other Brew phones (AudioVox 9500 and Motorola T720 are known

	to work).  The wallpaper and ringtone stuff should <b>NOT</b> be used on these

	other phones.

	<li><p>If you add an entry in the phonebook, the label for that

	row is now updated when you change the name.

	<li><p>Ignore the files Windows dumps in the BitPim directories (thumbs.db,

	desktop.ini etc)

	<li><p>Update to wxPython 2.4.0.6

	<li><p>Changed field sizes in status bar so that they are less likely to

	truncate on smaller screens

	<li><p>Group strings are now read from the phone

	<li><p>Pressing enter in phonebook moves selection to the right rather than down

	<li><p>Updating log text and protocol log is now down in an OnIdle handler.  This

	means the user interface remains usable even when large amounts of logging happen.

	Feel free to watch as much logging as you want when you want

    </ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.4</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>Serial numbers on phonebook entries are now preserved when

      writing to the phone.  This means you won't lose speeddials and

      voicedials (as happened with 0.3).

      </il>

	</ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.3</h2>



    <ul>



      <li><p>Cope with ringtones directory not existing on phone



	<li><p>Cope with wallpapers directory not existing on phone



      <li><p>Can now write out your phonebook.



	<li><p>Can now crudely edit your phonebook



	<li><p>Changed wallpaper size to be 120x98 instead of 120x100 so

	that it comes out correctly centered vertically



	<li><p>The ondisk format of the phonebook has changed.  If you

	used 0.2, please delete any stored phonebook (defaults to

	<code>My&nbsp;Documents\\bitpim\\phonebook\\index.idx</code>)

	otherwise BitPim may refuse to start.



	</ul>







      <h2>Changes in 0.2</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>Fixed the issue of wallpapers inside a certain size range

      causing image load failures in the user interface.

      <li><p>Wallpapers that are resized won't have a one pixel wide

      black line in the framing area.

      <li><p>Phonebook is now saved to disk when read.

      <li><p>The underlying plumbing for the phonebook has been sorted out which will make

	editing it possible soon



</ul>



      <h2>Changes in 0.1</h2>



    <ul>

      <li><p>First alpha release

    </ul>
