<p>Before posting anywhere, please take the time to read this article
on URL(http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html,How to ask
questions the smart way) (Note they do NOT provide support, just
guidelines on how to ask questions/get support and get the best
responses).  Then follow the steps described below:

<p>Before making a support request, please gather up the following information
where possible.  The goal is to ensure you have the relevant information
so that the issue can be addressed as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

<p><font size="+2">If you cannot get BitPim to talk to your phone at all, you need to
follow the steps in <a href="trouble-serial.htm">serial troubleshooting</a> 
first.</font>

<p>If you still cannot get BitPim to talk to your phone then you are out
of luck.  <a href="bitpim-user-no-support.htm">This page</a> details why.

<dl>

<dt>Summary<br>&nbsp;

<dd>Start with the following items.  If you leave them out, we will have to ask
and it will delay getting to a solution for you.  BitPim supports multiple
phones, operating systems and cables, and they all affect issues you may have.

<p><ul>
<li>Which version of BitPim you are using
<li>What operating system you are using
<li>Which cell phone you are talking to (make and model)
<li>What cable you are using to talk to the phone

</ul>
<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Make notes<br>&nbsp;

<dd>You will need to gather information as described in the following points.
The most important notes to start with are a description of what happened and a
description of what you expected to happen.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>If you got an <a href="errors-exception.htm">exception dialog</a>, please
copy the contents.<br>&nbsp;
<dd>This will show what happened at the point of the problem.  The contents
of the dialog are in the Log pane. <b>Note</b> that you must include the other
contents of the log pane in addition to the exception.  This is so we can
tell what BitPim was doing leading up to the exception.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Get a copy of the contents of the <a href="tab-log.htm">Log</a> pane.<br>&nbsp;
<dd>This will show the history of actions BitPim was doing<br>&nbsp;

<dt>What set of steps did you take<br>&nbsp;
<dd>Work out the set of steps you did.  This is to enable others to do the same
set of steps in order to reproduce your problem.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Is it repeatable?<br>&nbsp;
<dd>Does the problem happen every time.  If it does, it is far easier to track down
the cause and fix.  Even if it isn't repeatable, there may be enough information
from the previous steps to diagnose and fix it.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>What have you tried?<br>&nbsp;

<dd>In your attempts to fix the issue, what have you already tried, and what
happened.?<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Look on the web and in archives<br>&nbsp;

<dd>Do a Google search incorporating lines of the error message, symptoms or
what you have tried.  You can also search the mailing list archives at
URL(http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=31264,SourceForge) or at URL(http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mobile.bitpim.user,Gmane).
Phone specific groups should also have their archives and search facilities.

</dl>

<h2>Where to make your request</h2>

<p><b>You should check the archives at URL(http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=31264,SourceForge)
or URL(http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mobile.bitpim.user,Gmane)
to see if your problem has already
been reported and solved.</b>

<h3><a name="bitpim-user">BitPim Mailing list</a></h3>

<p>You can post about your problem to the <a href="contacts.htm">bitpim-user</a> 
mailing list.  This is read and responded to by a wide variety of BitPim users and
developers, and you will get rapid responses if you have followed these guidelines
fully.  Please use this list for issues with BitPim itself.

<p>Your posts should have a subject that indicates which phone you have, which
operating system you are using, the type of cable you are using and an indication 
of the problem.

<p><blockquote><b>Note:  The mailing list does not provide support for the various
operating systems or for configuring device drivers.  If you cannot get BitPim to talk to your phone then <a href="bitpim-user-no-support.htm">tough luck</a>.</b>.  It only provides support for the BitPim software.
</blockquote>

<h3>Phone specific resources</h3>

<p>Some problems are more to do with the phones and how to use them.  The help pages
for <A HREF="phones.htm">the phones</A> list various web pages, forums and mailings
specific to those phones.

<h1><a name="donotdo">Do not do</a></h1>

<p>Do not do any of the following.  It takes up lots of other people's valuable time,
and often annoys them.  If you do any of them, you will likely just be ignored.

<dl>

<dt>Mail individual developers<br>&nbsp;

<dd>If the developer responds, the answer won't appear in any archives and so
won't help other users.  Other users won't be able to comment on the issue
such as workarounds they have discovered or indications if the issue is unique
to your configuration or affects everyone.  Additionally the developers schedule
their time carefully so your answer is unlikely to be timely anyway.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Mail/post in multiple locations<br>&nbsp;

<dd>Some people think they will get quicker answers by posting to mailing lists,
filling out SourceForge tracker items, and emailing individual developers.  I
can assure you that no one wants to answer/address the same issue two or more times.
And if you are seen posting the same thing in more than one location, the people who
can answer will wait a long time to ensure you aren't also posting in others (remember
they usually participate in multiple locations as well).<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Be impatient<br>&nbsp;

<dd>Some people seem to get upset if their issues are not answered immediately.
Remember that other people have their own lives and responsibilities and contribute
as their own schedules and priorities allow.  If you have given a detailed report,
they may be doing research.  After all, a good question deserves a good answer.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Post no information<br>&nbsp;

<dd>One report consisted of "When BitPim talks to my phone, it gets some sort of exception".
BitPim does fundamentally work with the phones we support.  There may be some issues
but we don't release software that just doesn't work.  Furthermore not giving any information
at all about what happened, the contents of the exception etc means no one can help.  Follow the
steps at the top of this page.<br>&nbsp;

<dt>Ignoring archives<br>&nbsp;

<dd>Many questions have already been asked and answered (multiple times).  Check the archives!
