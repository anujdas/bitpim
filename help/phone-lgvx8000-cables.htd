<h3>RPI Wireless straight USB with charging</h3>

<p>Available from URL(misc-rpiwireless.htm,www.rpiwireless.com).  
RPI were kind enough to loan a VX8000 to add support to BitPim.  You
can thank them by placing your order with them.  Don't forget to mention
that BitPim sent you!  Note that the VX7000 and VX8000 use exactly the
same cable.
