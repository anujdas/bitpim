    <h1>Supporting a phone in BitPim</h1>

    <p>This document describes how to support a phone in BitPim.  The
    intention of the implementation behind BitPim is to allow both a
    GUI driven user interface as well as a command line driven one
    (although the latter has not been implemented).  It is also good
    abstraction to keep phone communication details and the actual UI
    etc seperate.

    <p>In the GUI version of BitPim, the UI operates in the main
    thread, and the phone communication code operates in a background
    thread.  This keeps the UI responsive and means the phone thread
    doesn't have to remember state and be event driven.  It also means
    that the phone thread cannot make any gui requests.  In the
    command line version, everything will run in the main (and only)
    thread.

    <p>You should browse through the source and become familiar with
    the layout and purpose of each module.  The developer page has
    links to the apidoc and cross-referenced source.  If there is a
    function with no or inadequate documentation, please point it out
    on the bitpim-devel list.  I consider that a bug and will fix it
    immediately.

    <h1>Example</h1>

    <p>The best example to look at is the LG VX4400.  This was the
    first phone implemented, and is the most feature complete.

    <h1>Your code</h1>

    <p>You should put the code that implements your phone into a file
    with the prefix com_ (for example com_lgvx4400.py).  The code
    executed in the communications thread should be a class named
    Phone.  You will want to multiply inherit from the base phone
    class (com_phone.Phone) as well as from other phone classes (eg
    com_brew.BrewProtocol).  There may also be a base class for the
    manufacturer of your phone since there is normally a lot in common
    for all models (for example com_lg is common for all LG phones).

    <p>The phone is always in a mode (starting with MODE_NONE).  You
    may add extra modes or more typically your base classes will.  For
    example com_brew adds MODE_BREW.  The modes are used to switch the
    phone into different modes (for example brew, phonebook, modem).
    com_phone.Phone defines the setmode function which changes to a
    new mode and documents how the mode transition happens.

    <p>You need to add a config value for your phone together with the
    basename of the module at the start of ConfigDialog in
    guiwidgets.py.

    <p>You will also likely need to describe the protocol used by your
    phone.  The protocol descriptions go in p_*.p files.  Run
    <code>protogen.py</code> to compile the .p files into .py

    <p>The file packetdescription.txt describes the format and
    functionality of the descriptions.  It is also highly recommended
    that you run analyser.py supplying various files in the examples
    directory.  This will give you and idea as to how the other phones
    work.  You can also use this to work on your description.

    <p>While running BitPim, you can turn on the protocol log view.
    If you press ctrl-alt-p the protocol analyser will appear.  If
    will import whatever text you had selected, or all of it if there
    was no selection.  You can also copy and paste the text to save
    for a file to put in examples.

    <p>It is a good idea to contribute some files to examples.  It
    lets other developers see what the protocol and record formats
    look like on your phone.  You should try to make the examples
    interesting and featureful.  For example for a phonebook record
    you may want to fill out every number to the maximum number of
    digits.  Since the files are public you should not use private
    data.

    <p>You also need a second class, named Profile.  All the methods
    in this class are called from the gui thread and are to do with
    gui interaction between the gui and your phone.  For example it
    munges phonebook data into a format suitable for the phone and can
    generate warnings.  It also returns what the size and format
    constraints are for images.

    <p>Many of the methods take a dictionary as a parameter.  Your
    methods are expected to return information by adding new keys and
    can consult other keys to get more information.

<h1>Calling convention</h1>

<pre>
- mention results/data dict parameter
</pre>

<h1>Phone requirements</h1>

<pre>
serials source and unique id stuff
</pre>

    <h1>Methods in your Phone class</h1>

<dl>

<dt>getfundamentals

<dd>This method should get any data off the phone that may be necessary
for other methods in the Phone or Profile classes to use when processing
data.

<p>In the LGVX4400 code, this method retrieves the wallpaper and ringtone
indices (needed to convert the wallpaper and ringtone names into numbers
as used in the phonebook and calendar).  It also gets hash of the ESN
of the phone.

<dt>getphonebook

<dd>This method retrieves the phonebook.  It should update the 'phonebook'
key with the phonebook.  Each entry in the dict should have a value in the
same format as specified in the top of phonebook.py.  The user interface
will then deal with merging or replacing of the results.

<dt>savephonebook

<dd>This method saves the phonebook to the phone.  By convention the 
convertphonebooktophone method in Profile will munge the phonebook
into something suitable for this method and save it back into the
phonebook key.

<p>You will probably also want to update the serials for each
entry (especially for new entries).  You can add a key named
serialupdates.  It is a list of tuple.  Each tuple consists
of the bitpim serial for an entry (sourcetype="bitpim") and
your serial update.  See the updateserials() function in
phonebook.py for more information.

</dl>
<pre>
getcalendar
savecalendar
getringtones
saveringtones
getwallpapers
savewallpapers
</pre>

    <h1>Methods in your Profile class</h1>

<pre>
convertphonebooktophone - don't conv wallpaper and ringtone names since they
    may be updated after call to this fun

</pre>

    <h1>Constants in your Profile class</h1>

    <h2>usbids</h2>

    <p>This is a list of tuples (vendorid, productid, interfacenumber) that
      correspond to the device.  You should include USB to serial converters.
      You must have an interface number for the device to accessible via
      libusb.  If you only work through OS device drivers then interfacenumber
      can be none.

    <p>The list should be in most preferred first.  Typically you would list
      direct USB connections before USB to serial converters.
      
    <h2>deviceclasses</h2>

    A tuple containing one or both of <code>"serial"</code> and <code>"modem"</code>.
    This is used to filter out interfaces for composite devices in the detection
    code.  For example the LG VX4400 presents both a modem interface and a serial
    interface.  BitPim can only talk to the serial interface as the modem interface
    only does modem stuff.  The Sanyo phones only present a modem interface.

    <h2>WALLPAPER_WIDTH WALLPAPER_HEIGHT</h2>
    
    <p>The normal width and height of wallpapers for use on the
    device.  These values are used for auto resizing when the user
    adds a new wallpaper (eg via drag and drop).  Wallpapers and
    images from the phone are not resized unless the user explicitly
    asks for it (ie you don't have to worry about camera images being
    resized to this size).

    <h2>MAX_WALLPAPER_BASENAME_LENGTH</h2>

    <p>The maximum length of a wallpaper filename extension.  Files
    added via BitPim will be truncated if necessary.

    <h2>WALLPAPER_FILENAME_CHARS</h2>

    <p>A list of acceptable characters in wallpaper filenames.  Any
    characters not in the list will be removed when files are added
    via BitPim.  If there are no upper case letters then names are
    converted to lowercase, and if there are no lowercase letters then
    names are converted to uppercase.

    <h2>WALLPAPER_CONVERT_FORMAT</h2>

    <p>The file extension that wallpapers are automatically converted
      to (without the dot).  Examples are 'bmp', 'jpg' and 'png'.

    <h1>Calling sequence</h1>
    
    <p>Remember that all methods in Phone are called in comms thread
    and all methods in Profile are called in gui thread.  If the user
    has selected multiple actions (eg write phonebook and ringtones)
    then Phone.getfundamentals is called only once first, all Profile
    methods are called, and then Phone methods are called.

    <h2>Reading phonebook</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Phone.getfundamentals
      <li>Phone.getphonebook
    </ul>


    <h2>Writing phonebook</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Phone.getfundamentals 
      <li>Profile.convertphonebooktophone
      <li>Phone.savephonebook
    </ul>

<h1>Monolog on adding phone support...</h1>

<p>Each phone supported by bitpim has two source files and one protocol file.
The protocol file is used to generate one of the protocol files.
Say you wanted to add support for a new phone "newphone". The filenames would be
<pre>
com_newphone.py
p_newphone.p
p_newphone.py (this one is generated when you run protogen.py, you do not edit it)
</pre>

<p>To make things easy for yourself you should copy one of the existing phones in bitpim.
Try to choose a phone which is similar, i.e. the same manufacturer and the same basic
feature set. Do a search and replace on the model name to create your new files.
Remember to run protogen.py to generate the protocol source file. Make sure you change the 
import directive in the com_newphone to use the new p_newphone file.

<p>To make your phone appear in the list of supported phones edit guiwidgets.py. 
Find the ConfigDialog class (~ln 340) and add your new phone to the list, the second
field in the list is the filename of the new file you just created without the extension.

<p>In the p_newphone.py are a bunch of PACKET defnintions, these tell bitpim how to communicate
with your phone. You have to create a PACKET definition for the files and messages you are decoding.
Most of the time if you are copying a similar phone these PACKET definition will not need to 
be changed, or if they do the change will be slight, often the size of a field will change from
one model to another. The SMS PACKET definitions on the LG phones are a really good example of
how the manufacturers constantly change things.

<p>Figuring out the correct PACKET definitions is probably the hardest thing to do. There are 2 ways
to get data from the phone, Sending messages over the serial port and reading/writing the phone's 
filesystem directly. In general using the serial port to send messages is better than directly accessing
the filesystem as the serial protocols change less from one phone to another. Also writing the
filesystem directly can require a phone reboot for the changes to take effect.

<p>These packet definitions get used by get and save functions in the com_newphone.py class.

<p>The com_newphone class contains 2 classes that your phone inherits from and overrides.
<p><b>Phone</b> - 
<p>This class is where you will write most of the code to convert from the phone's proprietary
format into the standard bitpim format. The get and save functions are called by bitpim to
read and write things like the phonebook, calendar and ringtones.
<p><b>Profile</b> - 
<p>This class contains static information about your phone that bitpim needs.
This includes things likde the usbIDs, the size of the wallpaper files, valid characters for filenames
and other infomation. It can also contain helper functions that bitpim uses to convert data from the
bitpim format into a format that is more convenient for your Phone class to manipulate.

<h2> Really important info...</h2>
<p>The get and save functions (in the Phone class). There is one pair for each feature supported by 
bitpim, these functions are what bitpim uses to talk to your phone:
<pre>
getmemo, savememo
getsms, savesms
gettodo, savetodo
getcalendar, savecalendar
getwallpapers, savewallpapers
getringtones, saveringtones
getcallhistory, (no save function for call history)
</pre>

<p>If you are copying an existing phone then it is very likely that some or all of the code
you need to make the phone work is already written and all you have to do is tweek the 
PACKET definitions in the p_newphone.p file. It is better to reuse existing code than duplicate 
it.

<p>If you want to add support for a new feature that is not supported like say SMS or memo the 
following will help...

<p>You need to add code to your phone class to allow bitpim to access the SMS (or memo etc)
 messages on your phone.
<p>As mentioned before, for each type of data bitpim retrieves there is a get and a save 
function defined, so to add SMS support you have to implement getsms() and savesms(). 
You need to implement these functions in the Phone class in the com_newphone.py file.

<p>In the Profile class you define the features supported by the phone, look for the 
_supportedsyncs list, you need to add SMS (or whatever new feature you are adding) to this,
note that SMS write only allows the user to change the prewritten presponses at the moment. 

<p>For example, this is the _supportedsync from the lgvx4400, it supports everything except the 
todo feature (limitation of the phone not bitpim). 
<p>This list determines what options are greyed out in the get/send data dialog boxes in bitpim.
<pre>
    _supportedsyncs=(
        ('phonebook', 'read', None),  # all phonebook reading
        ('calendar', 'read', None),   # all calendar reading
        ('wallpaper', 'read', None),  # all wallpaper reading
        ('ringtone', 'read', None),   # all ringtone reading
        ('call_history', 'read', None),# all call history list reading
        ('sms', 'read', None),         # all SMS list reading
        ('phonebook', 'write', 'OVERWRITE'),  # only overwriting phonebook
        ('calendar', 'write', 'OVERWRITE'),   # only overwriting calendar
        ('wallpaper', 'write', 'MERGE'),      # merge and overwrite wallpaper
        ('wallpaper', 'write', 'OVERWRITE'),
        ('ringtone', 'write', 'MERGE'),      # merge and overwrite ringtone
        ('ringtone', 'write', 'OVERWRITE'),
        ('sms', 'write', 'OVERWRITE'),        # all SMS list writing
        )
</pre>

<p>The contents of the getsms() function in your phone will decode the proprietary contents of 
files on your phone and convert them into a standard format understood by bitpim. 
Bitpim expects the data to be stored in records in a python dictionary data type. 
The easiest way to do this is to copy code from another phone. I would recommend the 
com_lgvx4400. Many other phones also implement this, most of the LG family uses the code in 
the 4400, but the other models contain other implmentations you can copy. 
Just search for getsms() or whatever function you are trying to add to find them.

<p>As a rule try not to duplicate code from other phones, it is much better to add code to a base
class and allow the code to be shared. This makes maintaining the code easier.
