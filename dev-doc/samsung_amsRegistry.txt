The Samsung SPH-A620, and some other Sprint Samsung phones have a file
ams/amsRegistry that contains information about downloaded files.  The
following are some notes about the format of this file by Todd Imboden.

--

Using 36 bytes/row 

starting at an offset of 00000900 is where the first record is shown

starting at offset 00014420 is where the descriptions are, these relate to the gcd files that are for each ringer/screensaver etc.
each of the numbers given in the first set will relate to the decriptions by adding 14420 to it

on the phone itself if you look at the info for a ringer it has
[Name]
[Version]
[Vendor]
[File Type]
[Download Domain]
[Size]

going back to the first set of numbers (or records) I have labeled them as to what they are records for (ie ringer, game, app, screensaver)

now we look at the columns
offset 00-01 give the directory location
offset 02-03 ?
offset 04-05 give the name location
offset 06-07 give the version location
offset 08-09 give the vendor location
offset 10-11 give the Download Domain location
offset 12-13 ?
offset 14-15 ?
offset 16-19 Filesize (this is the size of the file and it's gcd descriptor)
offset 20-21 ? (I think this may be some kind of file type as applications and games are 0f00, ringers are 0c00 and screensavers are 0d00)
offset 22-23 gives the Mime Type location (for games and app this is just ff00 but for screensavers and ringers it gives a location which tells the phone if it is .mid or .qcp or .jpg etc)
offset 24-25 gives the ID location/Net access 
	(for screensavers and ringers this is a location/for games and apps this is a descriptor for net access) 
	for apps 
	0001 is prompt 
	0201 is always allow
	0301 is never allow. 
	for games 
	0300 is never allow 
	0400 is prompt  
	0500 is always allow
offset 26-27 Ringer Numbering (for anything but ringers this is 0000 but for ringers its a number that increases sequentially, I assume for linking the pbook entries to the ringers)
offset 28-29 ?
offset 30-32 Association (for apps and games this is 0000, but for the screensavers and ringers it's a number if that file is associate with something (ie screensaver as the screensaver or the ringers associated with a pbook entry)
	if a screensaver pic is the main image then this number is 0001
	if a ringer is set as a pbook entry this number is 0002
	(looking at the excel file records 19,22,and 25... those ringers are not associated with anything in my phone)
offset 33-36 Always 6400 0000 for all records, even blank ones
