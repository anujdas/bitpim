	Information on SCH-8500 with some AT commands

http://lager.dyndns.org/sambru/allcommands.txt
	Results of scanning through 500,000 AT commands to see what
	works on the SCH-6100/SCH-8500

http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/83000-1.html
	Info about S105.  Note AT+MELW, AT+IMGW command for file and
	image transfer.  Perhaps files can be transferred without going
	into DM mode?

http://webpages.charter.net/hideo_a310/downs/TechNotes/a310_atcommands.txt
	Has commands for reading and writing group names and for reading
	builtin animations and ringers.

       Speed-dial, Group, Ringer, Picture ID

Photos in /digital_cam.  Have the names "Image001, Image002 ...).  Bytes
47:61 contain a yyyymmddHHMMSS timestamp.  If the timestamp is
19810104235959, the picture was taken while the phone was out of
service (and thus didn't know the time.)  Picture is retrieved by
removing the first 96 bytes of the file and saving it as a jpeg.

Unlike most other phones we have looked at, there does not seem to be
a file nvm/$SYS.ESN.

The 0 in the sixth returned field indicates that the Home number is  
dialed when the Location id (=10, 2nd field) is used for speed dial.
(0=Home, 1=Work, 2=Mobile, 3=Pager, 4=Fax)

Also the 4th to the last field where this has a "3" is a "5" when I  
test most of my real contacts. Could be related to the image file since  
these latter don't have an associated image.

SPH-A700 Sprint  (AKA MM-A700?)

DO NOT USE THIS PHONE WITH BITPIM or any program which puts the phone into
Brew/Diagnostic mode (done with AT$QCDMG).  It is reported that doing
this puts the phone permanently into diagnostic mode at which point
sync programs can no longer read and write the phonebook and the phone
can not be used a modem.
