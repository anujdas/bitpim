Notes on the AT command phonebook protocol used by various Samsung Phones.
Thanks to the following individuals for loans or information about these phones

       John Sabato, Loan of SPH-8500
       Vic Heintz, SPH-A670 information
       Mike Young, SPH-A610 information
       Jim Bailey, A700 information

Some links to information about Samsung phones.

http://navasgrp.home.att.net/tech/sch-8500/
	Information on SCH-8500 with some AT commands

http://lager.dyndns.org/sambru/allcommands.txt
	Results of scanning through 500,000 AT commands to see what
	works on the SCH-6100/SCH-8500

http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/83000-1.html
	Info about S105.  Note AT+MELW, AT+IMGW command for file and
	image transfer.  Perhaps files can be transferred without going
	into DM mode?

http://webpages.charter.net/hideo_a310/downs/TechNotes/a310_atcommands.txt
	Has commands for reading and writing group names and for reading
	builtin animations and ringers.

Note on field #18: Purpose of this field is unknown. It could be for website URLs or instant messenger screen names. Is is not double-quoted like the name or email field. It CAN have commas in it which may cause problems.

Note on field #24:  This id seems to be mapped to image file name and path in /nvm/nvm/brew_image. Mapping of the id to phonebook contact name appears to be in /nvm/nvm/dial_tbl

Here is the same phonebook entry after changing the caller-id image from a "Gallery" (digital cam) selection to a "My Image" (wallpaper) selection:

at#pbokr=42
#PBOKR: 42,10,3,18,"A test",2,0,5550000000,0,5551111111,0,5552222222,0,5553333333,0,5554444444,0,Alias  (48  chars),0,,,"Email (48 chars)",4,3,"",20041115T124103

Note the flag is now 4 and the wallpaper id is now 3.

Commas can be put in text fields with uncertain impact on AT#PBOKR. Double quote chars in text fields get replaced with the "}" char in the PBOKR response.

SPH A-670 on Telus network (Canada)                    
==========================================================================

   Date: Mon, 06 Dec 2004 14:43:52 -0000
   From: "Troy Strum" <tstrum@accesswave.ca>
Subject: AT Codes... (Telus + a670)


I ran all the possible "P" series AT codes against my phone (something
like 500,000 of them) and I came up with about 31 of them. 

Serial Settings: 115200, 8N1
Turn on local echo: atz
Turn on PCSync Mode: at#pmode=1
If you screw up a command, just type "at" and hit enter.

Interestingly, I noticed that when I tried to retrieve my phonebook, I
at first had access to one contact (not the 17 I had). Then later, I
had access to 2. This kept happening until I had 7 or so before I
figured it out:

at#pbsel responds with #PBSEL: 0,3,"1C2C3C"

This is somehow an internal regiter that shows how many contacts are
in the phonebook - and that started with 0,1,"1C" and worked up to
0,17,"1C...17C". It's read-only. However, every time I did with
"at#pmode=0" and then "at#pmode=1" it incremented. I ran that a few
times and now I have access to all 17 - and it *seems* new contacts
now show immediately without futzing, YMMV.

Anyway, the codes:

Decyphered:

memory_code (the 18 of at#pbokr=18)
normal_code (the code which the phonebook displays)
GROUP (See at#pbgrr=X (where X=0..4)
RINGER (corresponds with at#pugsn? except downloads are always 20 too)

"email1"
"email2"
birthday (mm/dd/yyyy)
20 (Seems always to be 20 in my phonebook?)
date (added or edited - YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS - where T is a literal T in
the string)

Setting the contact to secret seems to set all the is_secret fields to
1, disabling sets them all to 0. 

Before I added this entry, my previous entries were reverse order to
memory_code and normal_code - I had 17 entries, and it was
1..17,17..1. When I was finally able to access all my phone entries
from AT commends, I added an 18th entry via the phone, and both codes
matched. Strange. :)

==========================================================================
SPH-A700 Sprint  (AKA MM-A700?)

DO NOT USE THIS PHONE WITH BITPIM or any program which puts the phone into
Brew/Diagnostic mode (done with AT$QCDMG).  It is reported that doing
this puts the phone permanently into diagnostic mode at which point
sync programs can no longer read and write the phonebook and the phone
can not be used a modem.

Jan 2005: One user reports that the new "Switch to modem" mode option in the
filesystem viewer will take the A700 out of Brew/Diagnostic mode without
needing to reboot or totally reset the phone.
