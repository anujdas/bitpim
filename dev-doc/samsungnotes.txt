Note on field #18: Purpose of this field is unknown. It could be for website URLs or instant messenger screen names. Is is not double-quoted like the name or email field. It CAN have commas in it which may cause problems.

Note on field #24:  This id seems to be mapped to image file name and path in /nvm/nvm/brew_image. Mapping of the id to phonebook contact name appears to be in /nvm/nvm/dial_tbl

Here is the same phonebook entry after changing the caller-id image from a "Gallery" (digital cam) selection to a "My Image" (wallpaper) selection:

at#pbokr=42
#PBOKR: 42,10,3,18,"A test",2,0,5550000000,0,5551111111,0,5552222222,0,5553333333,0,5554444444,0,Alias  (48  chars),0,,,"Email (48 chars)",4,3,"",20041115T124103

Note the flag is now 4 and the wallpaper id is now 3.

Commas can be put in text fields with uncertain impact on AT#PBOKR. Double quote chars in text fields get replaced with the "}" char in the PBOKR response.

SPH A-670 on Telus network (Canada)                    
==========================================================================

   Date: Mon, 06 Dec 2004 14:43:52 -0000
   From: "Troy Strum" <tstrum@accesswave.ca>
Subject: AT Codes... (Telus + a670)


I ran all the possible "P" series AT codes against my phone (something
like 500,000 of them) and I came up with about 31 of them. 

Serial Settings: 115200, 8N1
Turn on local echo: atz
Turn on PCSync Mode: at#pmode=1
If you screw up a command, just type "at" and hit enter.

Interestingly, I noticed that when I tried to retrieve my phonebook, I
at first had access to one contact (not the 17 I had). Then later, I
had access to 2. This kept happening until I had 7 or so before I
figured it out:

at#pbsel responds with #PBSEL: 0,3,"1C2C3C"

This is somehow an internal regiter that shows how many contacts are
in the phonebook - and that started with 0,1,"1C" and worked up to
0,17,"1C...17C". It's read-only. However, every time I did with
"at#pmode=0" and then "at#pmode=1" it incremented. I ran that a few
times and now I have access to all 17 - and it *seems* new contacts
now show immediately without futzing, YMMV.

Anyway, the codes:

"email2"
birthday (mm/dd/yyyy)
20 (Seems always to be 20 in my phonebook?)
date (added or edited - YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS - where T is a literal T in
the string)

Setting the contact to secret seems to set all the is_secret fields to
1, disabling sets them all to 0. 

Before I added this entry, my previous entries were reverse order to
memory_code and normal_code - I had 17 entries, and it was
1..17,17..1. When I was finally able to access all my phone entries
from AT commends, I added an 18th entry via the phone, and both codes
matched. Strange. :)

DO NOT USE THIS PHONE WITH BITPIM or any program which puts the phone into
Brew/Diagnostic mode (done with AT$QCDMG).  It is reported that doing
this puts the phone permanently into diagnostic mode at which point
sync programs can no longer read and write the phonebook and the phone
