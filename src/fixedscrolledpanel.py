wxScrolledPanel with corrected behaviour.

This file has been modified from the original and remains under the same
license as the original.  (The original is in the wxPython distribution
as lib/scrolledpanel.py.  The following changes were made:

 - Doesn't automatically scroll back to the top when SetupScrolling()
   is called
 - OnChildFocus is broken down into one method to get child focus
   window, and a second method to scroll to make it visible
 - MakeChildVisible (second method from above) now works correctly
   if the child is not a direct child of the panel

wxScrolledPanel fills a "hole" in the implementation of wxScrolledWindow,
providing automatic scrollbar and scrolling behavior and the tab traversal
management that wxScrolledWindow lacks.  This code was based on the original
demo code showing how to do this, but is now available for general use
as a proper class (and the demo is now converted to just use it.)
